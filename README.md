# Style Guide:
* When assigned a user story, please make **1 branch per user story**. Name that branch the user story ID and description (i.e. `US01-dates-before-current`
* **Write your user story in a seperate function** or file and make it generic enough for unit testing.
* **Write your own unit tests** inside of the `test` directory as a class or function for our automated testing.
* **Make your function name** start with the user story id (i.e. `def us01DatesBeforeCurrent(date):`)

### Technologies used:
* Python
* SQLite
* PrettyTable
* PyTest
