# Style Guide:
* When assigned a user story, please make 1 branch per user story. Name that branch the user story ID and description (i.e. `US01-dates-before-current`
* Please write your user story in a seperate function or file and make it generic enough for unit testing.
* Please write your own unit tests inside of the `test` directory as a class or function for our automated testing.

# Debugging?

# Running PyTest?
* Make sure the required `.ged` files are inside the `tests` directory.
